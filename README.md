# Dog or cat

A little mobile toy to have some fun with react-native/expo.

NB: Best bet is to download the source and build the app (see below). This is tested on an android device so unknown if this works on iOS. Definitely doesn't work on desktop web and animations don't work on mobile web.

## Demo

## Installing the app

This is set up using expo & eas, so it should be similar to any other project using those tools.

In order to build a version run

```sh
eas build -p android --profile development # or production
```

Add the `--local` param to build locally (doesn't work on Windows but can work on WSL)

Send the produced APK to your device and install it.

If the development version is installed, it will need to connect to the development server run with `npx start`, add `-- --tunnel` on WSL.
